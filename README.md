A Simple Banking Application in Java is an ideal project
for coding beginners. It covers fundamental concepts
like the Scanner class for input, strings, loops, methods,
and conditional statements. This project involves basic
banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals,
checking balances, and exiting the program.

1. Plan the Application's Structure
The application will have the following operations:

Deposit money
Withdraw money
Check balance
Exit the application
2. Basic Components
Account Balance: A variable to store the current balance of the account.
Methods: Separate methods for deposit, withdraw, and balance checking.
Scanner: To allow user input.
Loops & Conditionals: For handling the operations in a continuous menu until the user exits.
3. Program Flow
Start by showing a menu with options (Deposit, Withdraw, Check Balance, Exit).
Let the user choose an option.
Based on the choice:
Deposit: Add money to the account balance.
Withdraw: Deduct money if the balance is sufficient.
Check Balance: Display the current balance.
Exit: Terminate the program.
4. task2.Java code available

Explanation of the Code
balance: A static variable to keep track of the user's bank account balance.
deposit(): Adds money to the balance, but ensures the deposit amount is positive.
withdraw(): Deducts money from the balance only if the withdrawal amount is positive and the balance is sufficient.
checkBalance(): Prints the current account balance.
Main Loop: Continuously displays the menu until the user chooses to exit. Each option invokes the corresponding method.
6. Enhancements and Error Handling
Input Validation: Ensure the user doesn't enter negative numbers or invalid data.
Multiple Accounts: Add the ability to manage multiple accounts using a class structure with Account objects.
Persistent Data: You can add file storage to save the account data across multiple runs.
7. Project Extensions
Once the basics are clear, you could enhance the project by:

Adding a login system for different users.
Handling exceptions such as invalid inputs with try-catch.
Incorporating file handling to store account data between sessions.
